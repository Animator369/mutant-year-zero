## Character Types:

**MUTANTS**,\
**ANIMALS**,\
**ROBOTS**,\
**HUMANS**,\
**NPC** -> a shorter version of a mutant/animal/robot/human \
**ARK**

## Skills:

**To add more skill to the character sheet you should drag them from the _SKILL_ compendium on to the character sheet. Only create your own custom skills if they are not present in the compendium or official content since the ones that come with the system/official content have _skill_key_ property that alows them to have _stunts_ and to have _modifier_ aplied.\


## Abilities:

**_Mutations, animal powers, modules and contacts_** are all represented by an Item called **ability**.\
Once created you can set the _ability_ to be one of the _4 types_.\
If you drag and ability that is not related to the specific character type to it's sheet it will be automaticaly converted to match.\
_For example if you drag an Animal Power to a Robot sheet the ability will be automaticaly converted to a Module._

## Talents - Secondary Functions:

Both **_Talents and Secondary Functions_** are represented by an Item called **Talent**.

-   You can specify the type of the talent on the Talent Item Sheet or
-   Talents dragged to a robot sheet or created from a robot sheet will be named 'Secondary Functions'.
